BoringSSL bindings are available for the Rust programming language, and the HTTP [Client](https://github.com/0x676e67/rquest) is built on top of it.

## Non-goals

This package only implements the TLS extensions spec and supports the original [boring](https://github.com/cloudflare/boring) with the following features:

* Safari and Firefox required TLS extensions
* kDHE, ffdhe2048 and ffdhe3072 implementations
* Removal of RPK support
